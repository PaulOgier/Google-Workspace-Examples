# Gemini Prompt Examples to work with your Gmail

The key here is using the Gemini side panel (Ask Gemini button) on an open email thread or from your main inbox. 

## Simple Gemini Prompts (Search & Triage) 
These prompts help you quickly find and understand emails that need action or filing. 
- **Urgent Search** "Show my unread emails from \[Manager's Name] sent in the last 3 days."
  - Gemini runs the advanced search and shows you the critical emails you need to address first. 
- **Information Find** "What is the tracking number for the package from Amazon that I ordered on Oct 15?"
  - Scans your entire inbox for the specific detail, allowing you to instantly file or reply without opening multiple emails.
- **Quick Summary** Click "Summarize this email" (on a long thread) Provides 3-5 bullet points of the conversation, letting you decide if it needs a label, reply, or archive.
- **Next Steps** "Create a list of action items for me based on the latest reply in this thread."
  - Identifies specific tasks you must do, making it easy to create a to-do list or label the email as To Do.


## Advanced Gemini Prompts (Analysis & Strategic Filing) 
These prompts use Gemini's power to analyze content, make comparisons, and generate content for better future organization. 
- **Project Summary** "Search all emails from Jane with the word 'Launch' in the subject line from Q3. What were the three main blockers discussed?"
  - Cross-searches and analyzes a specific set of emails to extract strategic information. You can then label all these found emails as Q3 - Launch Review.
- Vendor/Bid Comparison "Look at the last three emails from 'Vendor A' and 'Vendor B' that include the word 'Quote'. Compare their pricing and estimated delivery timelines in a simple table."
  - Forces Gemini to analyze and structure data across different threads, allowing you to make a quick decision and archive the non-selected quotes.
- Drafting a Filter List "Draft the exact search criteria I should use to filter all future emails from XYZ Newsletter and move them to a 'Reading' label."
  - Gemini outputs the precise text string (e.g., from:(newsletter@xyz.com) AND subject:(weekly digest)) that you can directly copy/paste into a Gmail filter.
- Topic Triage "Based on the first 5 unread emails in my inbox, suggest 3 new labels I should create to organize them, and explain which emails go into which label."
  - Uses the current inbox state to suggest a proactive labeling system, helping you decide on a long-term organization strategy.

## Quick Tip
For Filing Once Gemini gives you the information you need (e.g., "The main action item is to sign the contract by Friday"), you can immediately apply a relevant label like Urgent/Action or Waiting on Response to the thread, then archive it, knowing you've captured the key data.
